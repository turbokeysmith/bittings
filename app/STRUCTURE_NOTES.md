# Turbo Keysmith — App structure build (front-end only)

Branch: **`app-structure`** (off `public-website`). Nothing published. No cloud spend, no
credentials wired. All data is **localStorage today**; every read/write goes through one
data layer (`app/store.js`, `window.TKS`) with a single **CLOUD SWAP POINT**.

## Preview (local, still running)
- **Staff app** (dark): http://127.0.0.1:8088/  → Customers · Receipts · Scheduler · Payments · Inventory
- **Public site** (light): http://127.0.0.1:8099/  → contact form `/contact/`, language toggle 🌐 in the header

## Built so far
1. **Shared data layer** `app/store.js` — Customers / Inventory / Bookings over the existing
   `tks_*` keys, so the customer list is shared across every tile.
2. **Inventory tile** — list, add/edit/delete, qty +/- steppers, **low-stock flag**, search,
   summary chips, **supplier + reorder-qty** fields (low rows show a reorder hint).
3. **Contact form** (`site/contact/`) — saves a lead to the shared Customers list; fully bilingual.
4. **Scheduler day view** — hour grid from `tks_bookings`, tap an open slot to book; Google
   Calendar shown as a **NOT CONNECTED** placeholder.
5. **Connected tiles** — shared customer list + "‹ Apps" back links.
6. **Supabase CloudAdapter (READY, OFF)** — `app/store.js`. Cache-backed, same API as local;
   per-table mappers. Dormant until `TKS.connectCloud({url, anonKey})`.
7. **SQL** — `supabase/customers_setup.sql` (exists) + **`supabase/app_tables_setup.sql`**
   (inventory incl. supplier/reorder_qty, bookings, receipts) with RLS, policies, grants, triggers.
8. **Spanish toggle** — `site/assets/i18n.js`; chrome translated site-wide, homepage hero +
   contact form fully translated.
9. **Payments tile UI shell** — amount, shared-customer picker, method control, live Charge
   label; charging is a clearly-labeled demo stub.
10. **A11y + mobile pass** — labels associated, keyboard-operable rows, focus-visible outlines,
    16px inputs, ≥40px tap targets, reduced-motion, aria-live messages.

## ✅ What you need to give me to switch the CLOUD on
Do these and the app flips from localStorage to Supabase with no screen rewrites:

1. **Create the Supabase project** (or confirm reusing the one in `cloud-test.html`) and send me:
   - **Project URL** (e.g. `https://xxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon / publishable key**
2. **Run the SQL** in the Supabase SQL editor: `supabase/customers_setup.sql` then
   `supabase/app_tables_setup.sql`. (Tell me if you want me to combine them into one file.)
3. **Confirm auth method** — employees sign in how? (email+password already exists in
   `cloud-test.html`.) RLS only allows **authenticated** users, so the app must be behind login.
4. **Decide the data-sharing boundary** — are the public site and staff app served from the
   **same domain/origin**? (Determines whether the contact form's leads land in the same place
   pre-cloud; post-cloud they all share the DB.)
5. Then I will: add the supabase-js `<script>` to the staff pages, call
   `TKS.connectCloud({url, anonKey})` after login, run a one-time local→cloud migration of any
   demo data, and verify each tile reads/writes the cloud.

## ❓ Still need decisions on
- **Google Calendar** — real 2-way sync (needs Google OAuth + a server) or keep the current
  open/add-to-Google-Calendar deep links? (Sync needs a Google Cloud project + consent screen.)
- **Payments** — processor (Stripe / Square / other) and whether to fold payments into this app
  (needs server-side keys) or open the existing separate payment app (send its URL).
- **Spanish coverage** — chrome + homepage + contact are translated now. Want the full city/
  service page bodies translated too? (That's content work — I can do it page by page.)
- **Email/SMS on new leads** — where should contact-form submissions notify you?

## File map (this workstream)
- `app/store.js` — data layer + CloudAdapter (source of truth)
- `site/app/store.js` — public-site copy (kept in sync)
- `supabase/app_tables_setup.sql` — inventory/bookings/receipts schema
- `site/assets/i18n.js` — language toggle
- `index.html` — staff shell (Inventory + Payments live here)
- `scheduler.html` — day view added
- `site/contact/index.html` — contact form
